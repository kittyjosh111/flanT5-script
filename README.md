Some scripts to do text generation using FlanT5 and Hugging Face Transformers. Ensure you have a lot of RAM to run these. Also, the scripts only use CPU as they were originally run on Oracle Cloud's Free Tier, which does not have GPU support.

First use pip to install the ```requirements.txt```, then you can select which script to run. It will ask you for your prompt. Small, middle, and large indicate larger lengths and temperature values in their respective orders. Thus, the large script takes the longest to complete, and the fast is the shortest.

Examples are as follows. I am using venv on ubuntu with the 4 core, 24 GB RAM machine from Oracle Cloud. Both Fast and Middle took less than a minute to run. The Large option took at least five minutes to run.

*Fast:*
```
(venv) ubuntu@oracle:~/dev/flanT5-script$ python3 flanT5_fast.py 
Put in your prompt: How was your day today?
It was a good day for me because I didn't have to go to work today.
```

*Middle:*
```
(venv) ubuntu@oracle:~/dev/flanT5-script$ python3 flanT5_middle.py 
Put in your prompt: How was your day today?
It was a good day for me because I didn't have to go to work today and the weather was nice outside.
```

*Large:*
```
(venv) ubuntu@matrix:~/dev/flanT5-script$ python3 flanT5_large.py 
Put in your prompt:How was your day today?
It was a good day for me because I didn\'t have to go to work today and the weather was nice. My favorite part of the day was going to the park with my dog. We had a great time at the park. Then it was back to school, but not as busy as usual. There were lots of things to do in our neighborhood. Today we went on a bike ride around town. That was really fun. Our teacher gave us a lot of tips about how to be safe when riding your bike. They also taught us some new words that we don\'t know yet. All in all, it was a pretty good day overall. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful day with us. Have a great day! Bye! bye! Goodnight! Blessings! And thanks for reading! See you tomorrow! Love you! God bless! Happy Birthday!
